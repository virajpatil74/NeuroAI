            Recognizing the early signs of Alzheimer's and dementia is crucial
            for timely intervention and care. While some memory lapses and
            cognitive changes are a normal part of aging, there are specific
            symptoms that may indicate the onset of these conditions. Early
            detection can lead to better management and improved quality of
            life. In this guide, we outline the key signs and symptoms to be
            aware of, helping you and your loved ones stay informed and
            proactive.

            One of the most common signs of Alzheimer’s disease, especially in
            the early stage, is forgetting recently learned information.
            Others include forgetting important dates or events, asking the
            same questions over and over, and increasingly needing to rely on
            memory aids (e.g., reminder notes or electronic devices) or family
            members for things they used to handle on their own.

            If you notice one or more signs in yourself or another person, it
            can be difficult to know what to do. It’s natural to feel
            uncertain or nervous about discussing these changes with others.
            Voicing worries about your own health might make them seem more
            “real.” Or, you may fear upsetting someone by sharing observations
            about changes in his or her abilities or behavior. However, these
